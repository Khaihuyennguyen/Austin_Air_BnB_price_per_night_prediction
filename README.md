### Introduction

In this project, I have dome some data wrangling and visualization skills while examining the rental market (Air B&B) in downtown Austin which move from descriptive to predictive data science. My focus is real estate, and trying to test if my father is right about real estate: In this industry, location is the most important factor to determine price. I created a machine learning model that predicts apartment prices on the downtown.
